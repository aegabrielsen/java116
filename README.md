Java projects for my CSE116 class with Professor Jesse Hartloff. The AO2 folder contains a calculator I created that uses the state pattern to calculate numbers and does not contain loops or conditionals. Some starter code was provided for that (i.e. the blank calculator GUI with no functionality). The other folder contains the rest of the code created for class. There are 8 projects including one that can read MS Excel CSV files and sort information into a binary search tree (BST) for ease of access. Other projects combine the use of linked lists, graphs, inheritance, polymorphism, and JUnit testing.
